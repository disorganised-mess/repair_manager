# repair_manager
Repair Manager is a local desktop application built with **SQLite** for managing clients, jobs, and invoices for repair businesses.

This was created using AI, it works fine and is a simple program. Unless I find something not working correctly it will not be updated. If you improve it.... great. Do what you will with it if you find it useful.

## Features
- Manage **clients**, **jobs**, and **invoices**
- Mark invoices as **Paid** or **Outstanding**
- Search and filter clients, jobs, and invoices
- Export and import CSV data

- Preferences panel for theme, font size, and company details
- SQLite database stored locally for easy backup
